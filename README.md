I originally found these three roku remote battery cover replacements:

They all say they fit a roku3 remote. I currently have a roku 2, and have replacement remotes that aren't like the original so I don't know what remote I have. but the battery cover is distinctly different. It's much smaller than those other three.

this was my first modeling ever. I hope it helps someone.

the rear end curves from a single arc down to a curve made of 2 corners and a flat end. I didn't model this very well. so I'd like to learn better how to. It works good enough for me now though.

it's not in the pictures, but I added the hole for the wrist strap, and I added the grip indentations near the clip.
